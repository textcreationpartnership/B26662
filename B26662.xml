            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And therefore, if your children &amp; servants be not instructed &amp; taught in the word of God, you will not be able to give any good answer for it before the Lord, having lived in the neglect of so express &amp; plain, so serious and solemn a Commandement.

But I beseech you, let your care &amp; love to your children reach further, even to do your utmost endeavour to help forward the salvation of their precious and immortal soules; else never say you do truely love them. Nay in such case you cannot say you do truely love your selves. For the neglect of this duty will be your own disadvantage, and will further your own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort, both in this &amp; in another world.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199267:12"/> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 40. was <hi>busie here and there,</hi> he whom he should have kept was missing and <hi>gone:</hi> So while many men are busie here &amp; there about worldly imployments, the power and life of Religion, which they should have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept, is utterly lost and quite gone. <hi>The deceitfulness of riches, and cares of this life, do as thornes choak the seed of the word</hi> in many professours, that they <hi>become unfruitfull, Mark</hi> 4. 19. As Demas forsook Paul through <hi>love of this present world, 2 Tim:</hi> 4. 10. and Ezekiels hearers could not hear the word with profit, because their <hi>heart went after their coveteousness, Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. Oh therefore take heed, I do beseech you, least it be so with any of you, least earthly cares and encumbrances should dull your spirits, and take off their edge in the things of greatest importance, and lest by these things all the vigour of Religion should be wasted and worne out, and nothing be left but a dry &amp; sapless formallity, a spiritless &amp; powerless profession. You would be more happy if you could make a vertue of necessity, I mean if you could turn all the acts of your particular callings, all the imployments that God hath laid upō you about these earthly things, if you could turn them all into so many acts of Religion and Obedience towards God. Which is not a thing impossible, for the Apostle expressly requires it of Servants, that what ever they did (<hi>viz:</hi> in the labours of their callings) they should <hi>do it as unto Christ, as to the Lord and not unto men, Eph. 6. 5, 6 7. Col.</hi> 3. 22, 23. And if servants may do their works and dutyes of their places with such a spirit, why may not masters do theirs with the like spirit, and Parents theirs, and children theirs, and husband &amp; wives theirs, and every man &amp; euery woman perform their earthly imployments in such fear of God, in such singleness of heart, in such respect to the Cōmandement, that all these may be so many several acts of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towards God, so many parts &amp; expressions of the power &amp; practise of godliness? If Adam had not sinned, his <hi>dressing &amp; keeping the garden Gen:</hi> 2. 15. would have been so: and doubtless with our blessed Saviour it was so; for he was <hi>subject</hi> to Joseph &amp; Mary as a child to his parents, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 51. and it is like he wrought with Joseph at the work of a Carpenter, and therfore he was not only called the Carpenters son, but <hi>the Carpenter Mark</hi> 6. 3. and his Religious &amp; pious spirit would doubtless do all these external and earthly business with respect to God and in obedience to him. And the truth is, it is not only the object about which actions are conversant, but the heart wherewith they are done, and the grounds of doing them, with the ends that are aimed at therein, that makes them acts of Religion truly pleasing to God; So that if these be not right and spiritual, then preaching &amp; praying, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earing &amp; repeating Sermons, &amp; such like will be no better then acts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness &amp; ungodlyness, and in the issue be charged upon the doers as so many
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:199267:12"/> But on the contrary, civill imployments if they be performed with spiritual minds, upon such spiritual grounds, and to such spiritual ends as they might and ought, then these imployments even these will be accounted &amp; approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, as acts of religion &amp; godlyness, or obedience towards God, and as such will be pleasing in his sight. Wherefore, to make an end of this, let it be your care, and the Lord help you that you may do it effectually, that earthly or worldly imployments may not destroy nor diminish the life and power of godlyness &amp; religion, but that the life &amp; power of religion may breath and be put forth in all your earthly &amp; civil imployments.</p>

Imagine all the good in the whole world to be gathered into one store-house, and there to be laid up in one heap, you know he that were farr from that store-house and had no part there must needs be miserable; and even so is such a soul as is without the injoyment of God. If the Sun should depart out of the world there would be nothing left but dreadfull darkness upon all the Creation, all light being now placed in the Sun: and if the fountain be dryed up or stopped, all the streames must needs fail. In like sort take away the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God from any soul, and all that is left must needs be nothing worth, but even a lump of vanity &amp; evill. For the best of creatures without God are but vanity, yea &amp; vexation of spirit.
